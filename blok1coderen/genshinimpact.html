        My personal favorite game is Genshin Impact. It has been my favorite game for quite some time and every time I leaves me flabbergasted. The aestetic is wonderful. The nature in this game is
        something I love to see everytime over and over again. This game is in more specific words: adventurous, lovely and detailed. The way they developed the game makes it very easy to get lost in
        this alternative world. It has good ambiance and the story is so long that you can play it for as long as you like. I have currently been playing it for over 200 hours and I'm still not past
        50% of the game aswell as I have not discovered all of the map yet. I suggest if you like playing open world MMO's with a little bit of anime this game is definitly been made for you.
