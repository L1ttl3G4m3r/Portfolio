                <p>My name is <b>Kaylee Hoek</b> and I currently <em>(2023)</em> am studying at the <b>HVA</b> in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. I have a few hobbies that I like to share with you.</p>
                <p>
                  One of my most practised hobbies would be playing the <em>ukulele</em>. I have a <em>keyboard</em> and <em>harmonica</em> aswell, but I don't really play them that well. I
                  <b>love</b> making music as well as improvising and making something of my own. It gives me <b>motivation</b> to keep on following my <b>dreams</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another one of my big hobbies/lifestyle would be that I adore my dog <em>Baloo</em>. I care for him most of the time as well as: feed him, walk him, cuddle him and care for him. He
                  is my buddy for life and because of him I believe <b>"everyone can be kind to you as long as you keep giving."</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am a <b>huge</b> fan of <em>campfire</em> and <em>coziness</em>. If I could stay under a <em>blanket</em> all day with a warm cup of <em>tea</em> and a <em>fire</em> burning next
                  to me, I <b>definitly</b> will. I currently own about <em>three</em> blankets and I use then on a almost daily basis <em>(Ofcourse I don't use any in the summer)</em>. You will
                  probably catch me with <b>hoodies</b> on aswell.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And last but not least. I <b>love</b> to play games. Not only video games, but also games like: <em>Jenga, Cards against Humanity, Monopoly, The Game of Life</em> and so on. If you
                  want to keep me <b>awake</b> then the best way to do so is playing these games with me.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The whole reason why I made this <b>website</b> is, because of the games that I played on my <b>desktop</b>. I feel like I have played so many games in my life that I wanted to start
                  out with making my <b>own</b> <em>game library</em>.
                </p>
                <p>Now I do think the purpose of a <b>website</b> is for <em>other</em> people to see it. So making a <em>game library</em> for myself would benefit no one.</p>
                <p>
                  That's how I came up with the <b>idea</b> of leaving my own <em>review</em> of the games that I played so that if you wanted to <em>check out</em> any of the <b>games</b> that I
                  played, you will get a honest review + a <em>star rating</em> to help you make a <b>good</b> decision of your own.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I know that my <em>review</em> alone would not be as interesting as having <b>multiple</b> <em>reviews</em>. That is also why I would like <b>you</b> to send me <b>your</b>
                  <em>opinion</em> and help me set up this <b>website</b> for <b>you</b> all.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This <em>information</em> is something <b>I</b> will consider in the <em>reviews</em> of the <b>game</b>, making it <em>interesting</em> and <em>accurate</em>. Maybe <b>your</b>
                  <em>quote</em> will also be in the <em>review</em>!
