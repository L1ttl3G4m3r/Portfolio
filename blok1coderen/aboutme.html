          My name is Kaylee Hoek and I'm currently studying on the HVA in Amsterdam. This is my first project and for this project I have to make a website based on my interests. I decided to make my
          website about games that I played. I rate these games and give my own and honest opinion out them.
          I love to play games in my free time. I play all sorts of games. I like horror games as much as I like casual or adventerous games. I am also curious as to what kind of games there are and if
          there are new upcoming games I have probably one of the firsts to know. If I have not rated a game yet that you would like me to play and rate you should let me know in the "leave your input"
          section of this website.

        <p id="righttext">Hopefully you can get some inspiration from me as to what games you haven't played and get the information that you were seeking for. Thank you for visiting and good luck with gaming!</p>
